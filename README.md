Issues:

There is an issue where <span> tag set to hide inline text is not functioning, ie. it fails to hide enclosed text of choice
  
  This span tag is set in index.html > line 32 and contains id = "more" 
  The hide property "more" is set in corresponding document style.css > line 2
  Unrelatable but notable: the JS that controls the hide function is set in script.js > line 21 under "readMoreFunction"
