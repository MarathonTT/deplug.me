<h1 class="h1">14th June, 2022</h1>

<h2 class="h2">6:32AM - A breif intro on index funds cause ALL should know.</h2>

<h4 class="h4">In this first of hopefully many investment related posts, I touch on Stock investments.<br />
<br />
In this series I will only speak about my personal thoughts, research and decisions. We only make responsible investment decisions over here. With all investments there is a chance of winning and also a chance of losing.<br />
So I implore anyone reading this or interested in investing to do their own due diligence before making any decisions and personally I think one should never take financial advise directly and straightforwardly.</h4>

<h2 class="h2">Stocks: One of the easiest indexes, the S&amp;P</h2>

<h4 class="h4">Overtime money loses its value due to inflation, at a conservative rate of 2% every year. We can prevent inflation from eating into our checkbooks by investing in saving funds from <span id="dots">...</span>
<span id="more">banks or trust funds. Which in itself only give a return of 4-7% dividends per annum.</span><br />
<br />
Monetary investments that return more than this percentage simply aren&#39;t realistic based on the fact that it is way too much. The most popularly known way to realize these types of returns is to invest in shares. An easy way to think about investing in shares is that buying a share in a company is like owning a small percentage of it, and receiving dividends/profit based on your percentage ownership.<br />
<br />
Aside from navigating the market to check for expected growth, downturns and profitability and purchasing shares in individual companies. It is generally more commonplace to invest in funds that manage the purchase of multiple different stock from varying markets using the capital of millions of individual investors.<br />
Therefore resulting in x10 more stability in your returns as your dollar is pegged against many different companies that operate in different markets that aren&#39;t affected the same way by economic downturn or growth. So when one goes up or down it is measured and the loss from one investment is out-weighed by the profit in others.<br />
<br />
The profit difference between index investments and individual investments are that persons are usually given a set percentage of returns per annum where as if persons were to invest early in the stocks of a particular budding company which was to see growth, their capital investment would grow exponentially as the stock value of that company grows. Resulting in much higher profits.<br />
In the range of +30%, +100% even +%1000% in the case of early Tesla and Amazon investors.<br />
<br />
For example; Tesla which had initial stock prices of around 50USD well into being publicly traded and highs of a little more than 1,200USD up to November 2021.<br />
And Amazon which had initial stock prices of around 64USD well into being publicly traded and highs of a little more than 3,500USD up to July 2021.<br />
Note: These rates are per share.
</h4>

<h2 class="h2">What is a fund?</h2>

<h4 class="h4">A fund is where multiple investors pool their money which is invested by a fund manager with the sole goal of generating increased profits. A fund manager being an experienced financial expert who&#39;s financial decisions can be trusted.</h4>

<h2 class="h2">What are indexes?</h2>

<h4 class="h4">Indexes refer to collections of data from a chosen group of companies highlighting best performers, slow to growth, drop in share prices etc. This data is usually made up from a wide-swatch of companies in different industries such as natural gas, technology, agriculture, manufacturing, clothing - anything that is up.<br />
<br />
An index fund (IF) refers to funds (capital collectives) that are managed based on their own indexes and change their investments in various companies based on that.</h4>

<h2 class="h2">The beloved S&amp;P</h2>

<h4 class="h4">The S&amp;P is a financial fund / index fund that invests in the top 500 US companies at any particular point in time. For the past 60+ years the funds has had returns of average 10%.<br />
The fund self-cleanses based on company performance so investors more or less act as a part of a school group project that do no work but receive the rewards. Being totally made up of US companies this fund (S&amp;P500) operates similarly to the American economy. Even the growth curves of its share prices, going up and down, matches that of the US economy over the past 40 years.<br />
<br />
There are disadvantages to be noted in this as a downturn in the US economy will see a downturn in the profitability of the S&amp;P500. But the US economy, despite downturns at times, has and is still the leader internationally, soon to be surpassed by China in coming decades.<br />
Side Note: Being US based stock, dividends are taxed by 30% leaving owners with 70% profit per annum. Therefore, investing through international brokers such as Vanguard and Blackrock allow persons to feel reduced taxation costs of up to 15% (savings). Vanguard - VUSD | Blackrock - CSPX. These ETFs can be accessed through &quot;Interactive Brokers&quot; as they have access to UK stock markets.</h4>

<h2 class="h2">S&amp;P500 Crash of &#39;07</h2>

<h4 class="h4">In 2007 the S&amp;P500 was valued at 1,500USD per share growing in tandum with the US economy from it&#39;s valuation of 114USD when it began publicly trading in 1982. At that point there had been drops in the market before but in 2007 there were tremendous drops in share value at the start of the US financial crisis; the recession of 2008.<br />
The share price dropped by 51% leaving invested parties in an almost immediate loss. And took 5 whole years to get back it&#39;s previous valuation of 1,500USD.<br />
<br />
Persons who would have bought-in in 2007 at close to 1,500USD made varying decisions. Some were scared by the decrease and sold as they saw the price dropping gradually, thinking they would come out with a loss. Whereas persons who held unto their positions and didn&#39;t sell would have seen it re-establish itself as early as January 2013 and furthermore, see all time high growths of as high as 4,697USD in November 2021.<br />
<br />
I am stating this to say that long term investments such as index funds are essentially that, long term investments. These are made for stores of money over 5 &ndash; 10 years, sometimes even decades. So understanding the market and having faith in your investment is crucial as testing times come, as they always have.<br />
<br />
Two things are certain with the S&amp;P500. There will and has been dips as the American economy and financial industry have had its challenges. And there will and have only been upward growth as time goes on. Long and short of the story; your future self will NEVER regret investing. High-interest debt paid off &ndash; these compound the same as dividends and could counteract any real growth. Start an emergency fund (3 to 6 months living expenses). This allows for an extra layer of stability in times and cases where cash funds are needed. And don&rsquo;t invest money that you might need in the next 3-5 years
